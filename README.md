# Final-paper
Website for the final project


This is the website for our paper that looks at the effect of youth unemployment on youth political engagement in the European Union. The results of the analysis are visualized and presented graphically on the website for an average individual's easy understanding. 

Our results show that being unemployed leads to a decrease in political engagement of a young person. Moreover, individuals with higher levels of education tend to be more engaged in the political process
