Tori Dykes and Mansi Wadhwa


This repository contains the final paper and the website for the class along with all the relevant data and supporting files.

Our paper looks at the impact of youth unemployment on political engagement in the European Union. We find that being unemployed has a negative impact on political engagement. The effect of youth unemployment is discussed by taking into consideration factors like gender education levels, country-specific effect, union membership and satisfaction with democracy.
