Its three aims are, firstly - to monitor and interpret changing public attitudes and values within Europe and to investigate how they interact with Europe's changing institutions, secondly - to advance and consolidate improved methods of cross-national survey measurement in Europe and beyond, and thirdly - to develop a series of European social indicators, including attitudinal indicators.<br/><br/>The cumulative file contains data from countries that have been included in the integrated ESS files in two or more rounds (please see Version notes), and all variables from questions that have been asked in more than one round.<br/></td></tr><tr><th>Kind of Data:</th><td>Survey data</td></tr><tr><th>Unit of Analysis:</th><td>Individuals</td></tr></table></a></p><p><a name="scope"><table><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC" style="font-size:1.15em;" colspan="2"><strong>Scope &amp; Coverage</strong></td></tr><p><tr><th>Universe:</th><td>All persons aged 15 and over resident within private households, regardless of their nationality, citizenship, language or legal status, in the participating countries.</td></tr></p></table></a></p><p><a name="producers"><table><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC" style="font-size:1.15em;" colspan="2"><strong>Producers</strong></td></tr><tr><th>Primary Investigator(s):</th><td>The ESS Core Scientific Team (CST)</td></tr></table></a></p><p><a name="sampling"><table><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC" style="font-size:1.15em;" colspan="2"><strong>Sampling</strong></td></tr><tr><th>Time method:</th><td>Cross section.

All weights were rescaled in a way that the sum of the final weights equals n, i.e. Rescaled weights = n*w/sum(w).<br/><br/>POST-STRATIFICATION WEIGHTS:<br/>The purpose of the post-stratification weights (PSPWGHT) is to reduce sampling error and non-response bias, using auxiliary information. The ESS post-stratification weights have been constructed using information about age, gender, education and region. The ESS post-stratification weights also adjust for unequal selection probabilities (design weights).<br/>A raking procedure has been used in the production of the post-stratification weights.<br/><br/>POPULATION WEIGHTS:<br/>The Population size weight (PWEIGHT) corrects for population size when combining two or more country's data, and is calculated as PWEIGHT=[Population aged 15 years and over]/[(Net sample in data file)*10 000]</td></tr></table></a></p><p style="page-break-after:always;"/><p><a name="accessibility"><table><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC" style="font-size:1.15em;" colspan="2"><strong>Accessibility</strong></td></tr><tr><th>Distributor(s):</th><td>NSD - Norwegian Centre for Research Data,<br/> Harald Hårfagresgt. 29 N-5007 Bergen, Norway. <br/> Phone:+47 55 58 21 17<br/> Fax: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+47 44 58 96 50<br/> e-mail: nsd@nsd.no<br/> Web: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.nsd.no/english<br/> <br/> ESS: essdata@nsd.no<br/> ESS: www.europeansocialsurvey.org</td></tr><tr><th>Restrictions:</th><td>The data are available without restrictions, for not-for-profit purposes.</td></tr><tr><th>Citation requirements:</th><td>Citation of data: European Social Survey Cumulative File, ESS 1-7 (2016).
